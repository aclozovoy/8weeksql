-------- QUESTIONS --------
-- A. Customer Journey

-- Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table, write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey.

-- Try to keep it as short as possible - you may also want to run some sort of join to make your explanations a bit easier!

--SELECT *
--FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions AS s
--LEFT JOIN foodie_fi.plans AS p
--	ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id
--ORDER BY s.customer_id, s.start_date;

-- Users start with a free trial before upgrading to a paid subscription



-- B. Data Analysis Questions

-- 1. How many customers has Foodie-Fi ever had?
SELECT
	COUNT(DISTINCT s.customer_id) AS total_customers
FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions AS s;


-- 2. What is the monthly distribution of trial plan start_date values for our dataset - use the start of the month as the group by value
WITH temp AS (
SELECT
	*,
	to_char(s.start_date,'MM') AS start_month
FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions AS s
LEFT JOIN foodie_fi.plans AS p
	ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id
WHERE p.plan_name = 'trial'
ORDER BY s.customer_id, s.start_date
)

SELECT
	temp.start_month,
    COUNT(*)
FROM temp
GROUP BY temp.start_month
ORDER BY temp.start_month;

-- 3. What plan start_date values occur after the year 2020 for our dataset? Show the breakdown by count of events for each plan_name
SELECT
	p.plan_name,
    COUNT(*)
FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions AS s
LEFT JOIN foodie_fi.plans AS p
	ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id
WHERE CAST(to_char(s.start_date,'YYYY') AS INT) > 2020
GROUP BY p.plan_name
ORDER BY p.plan_name;



-- 4. What is the customer count and percentage of customers who have churned rounded to 1 decimal place?
-- WITH total AS (
SELECT
  CAST(
    (
    CAST(MAX((SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT s.customer_id)
    	FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions AS s
		LEFT JOIN foodie_fi.plans AS p
			ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id
		WHERE p.plan_name = 'churn')) AS DECIMAL(9,1))
    /
	CAST(MAX((SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT s.customer_id)
    	FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions AS s)) AS DECIMAL(9,1))
     )*100
   AS DECIMAL(9,1)) AS percent_churn
FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions AS s;


-- 5. How many customers have churned straight after their initial free trial - what percentage is this rounded to the nearest whole number?
WITH temp AS (
SELECT
	s.customer_id,
	CASE
  		WHEN STRING_AGG (p.plan_name, ', ') LIKE '%trial, churn%'
  		THEN true
  		ELSE false
  		END AS trial_only
FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions AS s
LEFT JOIN foodie_fi.plans AS p
	ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id
GROUP BY s.customer_id
ORDER BY s.customer_id
)

SELECT
  CAST(
    (
    CAST((SELECT
		COUNT(*) AS count_of_trial_only
		FROM temp
		WHERE trial_only = true) AS DECIMAL(9,2))
     /
     CAST(COUNT(*) AS DECIMAL(9,2))
     )*100
     AS DECIMAL(9,1)) AS percent_trial_only
FROM temp;


-- 6. What is the number and percentage of customer plans after their initial free trial?


-- 7. What is the customer count and percentage breakdown of all 5 plan_name values at 2020-12-31?
-- 8. How many customers have upgraded to an annual plan in 2020?
-- 9. How many days on average does it take for a customer to an annual plan from the day they join Foodie-Fi?
-- 10. Can you further breakdown this average value into 30 day periods (i.e. 0-30 days, 31-60 days etc)
-- 11. How many customers downgraded from a pro monthly to a basic monthly plan in 2020?
